### Running locally on your workstation 

For instructions guiding you through running Spin apps on your development workstation,
follow [this guide](/running-app).

### Deploying to Kubernetes

Spin applications can be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster with [SpinKube](https://www.spinkube.dev/docs/overview/) - an open source project that streamlines the experience of developing, deploying, and operating Wasm workloads on Kubernetes. Like Spin, SpinKube is a CNCF Sandbox project.

## Fermyon Cloud

[Fermyon Cloud](https://developer.fermyon.com/cloud) is a self-service application platform for WebAssembly-based serverless functions and microservices. It enables you to run Spin applications, at scale, in the cloud, without any infrastructure setup or maintenance required.
